# Architecture Decisions

Last Updated: 2025-01-06

## Key Architectural Choices

### 1. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Based Architecture
**Decision**: Use MCP as the primary integration mechanism
**Rationale**:
- Standardized protocol for AI model integration
- Enables tool abstraction and reusability
- Supports multi-agent coordination
- Provides clear boundaries between components

### 2. Dual-Mode Design
**Decision**: Implement two distinct modes (code-flow and claude-code)
**Rationale**:
- Separation of concerns between autonomous execution and general assistance
- Allows specialized optimization for each use case
- Enables gradual feature rollout
- Facilitates testing and debugging

### 3. Agent Pipeline Integration
**Decision**: Design for integration with RooCode agent ecosystem
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing agent capabilities
- Enables complex workflows through agent composition
- Reduces duplication of functionality
- Promotes modular architecture

### 4. Recursive Task Loop Pattern
**Decision**: Implement recursive task loops for autonomous operation
**Rationale**:
- Enables self-correcting behavior
- Supports iterative refinement
- Allows for complex multi-step operations
- Provides natural breakpoints for human oversight

## Tool Usage Patterns

### MCP Tool Workflow
1. **Discovery Phase**: `Glob`/`Grep` for codebase analysis
2. **Understanding Phase**: `Read` for detailed examination
3. **Modification Phase**: `MultiEdit` for precise changes
4. **Validation Phase**: `Bash` for testing
5. **Delegation Phase**: `Task` for complex subtasks
6. **Tracking Phase**: `TodoWrite` for progress management

### Tool Selection Criteria
- **Glob**: File discovery by pattern
- **Grep**: Content search across files
- **Read**: Detailed file examination
- **Edit/MultiEdit**: Single or batch modifications
- **Bash**: Command execution and testing
- **Task**: Complex operation delegation
- **TodoWrite/TodoRead**: Task management

## Integration Patterns

### Inter-Agent Communication
- Use standardized message formats
- Implement clear request/response patterns
- Maintain state through memory-manager
- Use reflection agent for quality checks

### Error Handling Strategy
- Fail gracefully with informative messages
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Log all operations for debugging
- Provide rollback capabilities where possible

## Security Considerations

### Code Execution Safety
- Sandbox all code execution
- Validate inputs before processing
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor resource usage

### Data Protection
- No hardcoded secrets
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper access controls
- Audit all file system operations

## Performance Optimization

### Efficiency Patterns
- Batch operations where possible
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Minimize file system operations
- Use parallel processing for independent tasks

### Resource Management
- Monitor memory usage
- Implement operation timeouts
- Clean up temporary resources
- Optimize for incremental updates

## Future Considerations

### Extensibility Points
- Plugin architecture for custom tools
- Configurable workflow templates
- Custom agent integrations
- External service hooks

### Scalability Planning
- Distributed task execution
- Persistent state management
- Multi-project support
- Performance monitoring integration
