## Coordination Protocol

### 1. Task Assignment
- Check `orchestration/agent_assignments.md` before starting work
- Update with your agent ID and current task
- Avoid duplicate efforts by coordinating through this file

### 2. Knowledge Sharing
- Document all discoveries in `memory_bank/`
- Include failed attempts to prevent repetition
- Share optimal parameters immediately upon discovery

### 3. Progress Updates
- Update `orchestration/progress_tracker.md` every significant step
- Mark subtasks complete in respective `subtasks/` files
- Alert other agents of blockers or dependencies

### 4. Integration Points
- Follow the plan in `orchestration/integration_plan.md`
- Test integrations incrementally
- Document any API or interface changes

## Communication Standards

### Status Markers
- ðŸŸ¢ COMPLETE - Task finished and tested
- ðŸŸ¡ IN_PROGRESS - Currently being worked on
- ðŸ”´ BLOCKED - Waiting on dependency or issue
- âšª TODO - Not yet started
- ðŸ”µ REVIEW - Needs peer review

### Update Format
```markdown
## [Timestamp] Agent: [Agent_ID]
**Task**: [Brief description]
**Status**: [Status marker]
**Details**: [What was done/discovered]
**Next**: [What needs to happen next]
```

## Critical Rules
1. **No Parallel Work** on same file without coordination
2. **Test Before Commit** - Run relevant tests before marking complete
3. **Document Failures** - Failed approaches are valuable knowledge
4. **Share Parameters** - Any calibration values found must be shared immediately
5. **Atomic Changes** - Make small, focused changes that can be tested independently
