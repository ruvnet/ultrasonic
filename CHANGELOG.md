4. **Real-time Capabilities**: Live audio processing for streaming applications
5. **Production Ready**: FastAPI web service with comprehensive error handling

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Embedding capacity**: Up to 64 bytes per audio segment
- **Detection accuracy**: >98% under optimal conditions
- **Processing speed**: Real-time for most audio formats
- **Frequency range**: 18,000-20,000 Hz (ultrasonic)
- **Bit duration**: 50-100ms for reliable detection

#### Known Limitations
